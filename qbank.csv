2,"Out of all the 2-digit integers between 1 and 100, a 2-digit number has to be selected at random. What is the probability that the selected number is not divisible by 7?",13/90,12/90,78/90,77/90,4
3,"Suppose a fair six-sided die is rolled once. If the value on the die is 1, 2, or 3, the die is rolled a second time. What is the probability that the sum total of values that turn up is at least 6?",10/21,5/12,2/3,1/6,2
4,Consider a random variable X that takes values +1 and −1 with probability 0.5 each. The values of the cumulative distribution function F(x) at x = −1 and +1 are,0 and 0.5,0 and 1,0.5 and 1,0.25 and 0.75,3
5,"If two fair coins are flipped and at least one of the outcomes is known to be a head, what is the probability that both outcomes are heads?",1/3,1/4,1/2,2/3,1
6,"If the difference between expectation of the square of a random variable (E[X²]) and the square of the expectation of the random variable (E[X])² is denoted by R, then?",R = 0,R < 0,R >= 0,R > 0,3
7,"Consider a finite sequence of random values X = { x1, x2,..., xn}. Let μx be the mean and σx be the standard deviation of X. Let another finite sequence Y of equal length be derived from this as yi = a*xi + b, where a and b are positive constants. Let μy be the mean and σy be the standard deviation of this sequence. Which one of the following statements is INCORRECT?",Index position of mode of X in X is the same as the index position of mode of Y in Y.,Index position of median of X in X is the same as the index position of median of Y in Y.,μy = aμx+b,σy = aσx+b,4
8,A deck of 5 cards (each carrying a distinct number from 1 to 5) is shuffled thoroughly. Two cards are then removed one at time from the deck. What is the probability that the two cards are selected with the number on the first card being one higher than the number on the second card?,1/5,4/25,1/4,2/5,1
9,Consider a company that assembles computers. The probability of a faulty assembly of any computer is p. The company therefore subjects each computer to a testing process.This testing process gives the correct result for any computer with a probability of q. What is the probability of a computer being declared faulty?,pq + (1 - p)(1 - q),(1 - q) p,(1 - p) q,pq,1
